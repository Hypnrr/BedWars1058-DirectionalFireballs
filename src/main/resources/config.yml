fireball:
  explosion-size: 3.0            # Default blaze fireball radius. Keep between 2.5-4.0 for best results.
  make-fire: true                # Drop temporary cosmetic fire on impact when enabled in arenas.
  min-horizontal: 0.15           # Lowest horizontal multiplier applied after blending to avoid zeroing small nudges.

  throw:
    enabled: true
    consume-item: true
    speed: 3.0                   # Fireball projectile launch speed multiplier.
    cooldown-ticks: 15           # Delay (in ticks) between manual throws to prevent spam.
    sound-enabled: true          # Optional: play configured sound on throw (requires server-side support).
    sound-volume: 1.0            # Volume for the throw sound when enabled.
    sound-pitch: 1.2             # Pitch for the throw sound when enabled.

  self:
    enabled: true
    horizontal: 1.15             # Baseline horizontal strength for straight self jumps before blending.
    vertical: 1.0                # Vertical velocity applied on ideal self fireball jumps.
    max-distance: 1.6            # Maximum distance from blast centre to qualify as a self jump.
    angle:
      pitch-threshold: 45.0      # Look at least this far downwards to be considered a self jump.
      front-cos-threshold: 0.3    # Dot threshold: smaller values favour self jumps when blast is front-facing.
    zero-horizontal:
      pitch-threshold: 75.0      # Looking nearly straight down triggers vertical-only boosts when stationary.
      max-distance: 1.0          # Self blast must be within this distance for zero horizontal to trigger.
      movement-threshold: 0.05   # Horizontal velocity below this counts as "not moving" for vertical-only jumps.
    y-under-threshold: 0.6       # If the explosion is this far below the player, bias towards self vertical boosts.

  side:
    horizontal: 1.15             # Default sideways push when the blast is beside or behind the player.
    vertical: 0.25               # Upwards motion for pure side hits (keep low for stability).
    front-cos-threshold: 0.5     # Above this, the strike is treated as primarily in front of the player.
    semi:
      pitch-min: 20.0            # Minimum pitch (abs) to blend between side and self responses.
      pitch-max: 40.0            # Maximum pitch (abs) to keep blending in the semi-side zone.
      horizontal: 1.1            # Horizontal scaling while in semi-side region.
      vertical: 0.5              # Vertical scaling while in semi-side region.
    self:
      pitch-max: 15.0            # Maximum pitch (abs) to treat nearby forward hits as side-self.
      front-cos-threshold: 0.6   # Require tighter forward alignment for side-self classification.
      horizontal: 1.1            # Horizontal strength for forward-facing side hits.
      vertical: 0.25             # Vertical strength for forward-facing side hits.
